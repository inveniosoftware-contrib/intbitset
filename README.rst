Installation
============

intbitset is on PyPI so all you need is a C compiler and pip: ::

    pip install intbitset

Documentation
=============

Provides an ``intbitset`` data object holding unordered sets of unsigned
integers with ultra fast set operations, implemented via bit vectors and
*Python C extension* to optimize speed and memory usage.

Emulates the Python built-in set class interface with some additional specific
methods such as its own fast dump and load marshalling functions.  ::

    >>> from intbitset import intbitset
    >>> x = intbitset([1,2,3])
    >>> y = intbitset([3,4,5])
    >>> x & y
    intbitset([3])
    >>> x | y
    intbitset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

``intbitset`` additionally support the `pickle protocol
<https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html>`_, the `iterator protocol
<https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types>`_ and can
behave like a ``sequence`` type.

Complete documentation is available at <http://intbitset.readthedocs.org> or
can be built using Sphinx: ::

    pip install Sphinx
    python setup.py build_sphinx

Testing
=======

Running the tests are as simple as: ::

    python setup.py test
