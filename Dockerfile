# Use Python-2.7:

# Install some prerequisites ahead of `setup.py` in order to profit
# from the docker build cache:
RUN pip install coveralls \
                cython \
                nose \
                six

# Add sources to `code` and work there:
WORKDIR /code
ADD . /code

# Install intbitset:
RUN pip install -e .

# Run container as user `intbitset` with UID `1000`, which should match
# current host user in most situations:
RUN adduser --uid 1000 --disabled-password --gecos '' intbitset && \
    chown -R intbitset:intbitset /code

# Run test suite instead of starting the application:
USER intbitset
CMD ["python", "setup.py", "test"]
